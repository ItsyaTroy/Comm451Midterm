<p>So you're a Right Twix kind of person, huh? Good choice! Right Twix is the superior Twix out of the two. Why? Well let me tell you why! <br> Right Twix has benefits to it, such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It has a whopping 3 layers of different flavors in just one bar</li>
  <li>It has a delicious cookie filling inside</li>
  <li>It's a hard candy bar on the outisde with a soft inside</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't even get me started on Left Twix, they're just awful! Do you know some of the negative effects about them? Well just to name a few: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Twix ranked at number six on a list of most unhealthy Halloween candies, due to its high calories</li>
  <li> The Fun Size Twix contains 250 calories, 17 grams of sugar and 14 grams of total fat</li>
  <li> They become stale way faster than the Right twix does</li>
</ul>
